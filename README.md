Jobify: From Monolith to Microservices with Spring Boot, Docker, and Kubernetes
Introduction
Jobify started as a monolithic Spring Boot application designed to manage job postings, company details, and user reviews. While the monolithic approach worked initially, it quickly became clear that it wasn’t scalable. To improve flexibility, maintainability, and scalability, the project was refactored into a microservices architecture. This transition involved containerizing services using Docker, managing inter-service communication with RabbitMQ, and deploying everything in Kubernetes for a cloud-native, scalable solution.
Building the Monolithic Application
The initial version of Jobify was a single Spring Boot application where all components—job postings, company management, and reviews—existed in one codebase. The application used Spring Data JPA for database interactions and was initially set up with an H2 database for local testing before switching to PostgreSQL for production. The decision to use PostgreSQL was based on its reliability and ability to handle complex queries efficiently.
During this phase, all services interacted within the same application, making it simple to develop but difficult to scale. Any update or feature addition required redeploying the entire application, leading to longer development cycles and potential downtime. This approach also posed challenges in terms of team collaboration, as multiple developers working on different features could easily create conflicts.
Moving to a Microservices Architecture
To address the limitations of the monolith, the project was broken down into three distinct microservices:
Company Service – Manages company information.
Job Service – Handles job postings.
Review Service – Manages user reviews.
Each microservice was developed as a separate Spring Boot application with its own database, ensuring better isolation and scalability. The advantage of this approach was that each service could be deployed, updated, and scaled independently. This also allowed different teams to work on separate services without stepping on each other’s toes.
One of the key challenges in transitioning to microservices was inter-service communication. In a monolith, method calls between different modules are straightforward, but in a distributed system, services need a reliable way to communicate. Initially, RestTemplate was used for HTTP requests, but it was later replaced with OpenFeign, which provided a more elegant way to handle service-to-service calls.
Introducing Asynchronous Communication with RabbitMQ
One major drawback of synchronous communication (REST API calls between services) is that if one service goes down, dependent services may fail. To make the system more resilient, RabbitMQ was introduced for asynchronous messaging. This allowed services to communicate through event-driven messages, reducing direct dependencies between them.
For example, when a new job posting was created, an event was published to a RabbitMQ queue. The Review Service could then listen for this event and automatically associate reviews with the newly created job, rather than waiting for direct API calls. This approach not only improved performance but also increased the system's fault tolerance.
Containerizing Microservices with Docker
Once the application was successfully refactored into microservices, the next step was to containerize each service to ensure consistency across different environments. Docker was used to package each microservice into a self-contained unit with all its dependencies.
This made deployment significantly easier, as each microservice could be run in any environment without worrying about missing dependencies or configuration mismatches. Additionally, Docker Compose was used to orchestrate multiple containers locally, allowing all microservices to run together with PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, and Zipkin (used for distributed tracing).
Deploying to Kubernetes
While Docker simplified container management, running multiple microservices in production required a more robust orchestration tool. Kubernetes was chosen for this purpose, as it provided powerful features like automatic scaling, self-healing, and load balancing.
The first step in Kubernetes deployment was setting up Minikube, a lightweight Kubernetes cluster for local testing. Each microservice was deployed as a Kubernetes Pod, and services were exposed using Kubernetes Services to enable internal communication. ConfigMaps and Secrets were used to manage environment-specific configurations securely.
Since microservices need to scale independently, Kubernetes Deployments were created to define replica counts, ensuring high availability. This allowed services like the Job Service to scale up during high traffic periods without affecting the Company or Review Services.
Monitoring and Debugging in Kubernetes
Once the application was up and running in Kubernetes, monitoring became a priority. Spring Boot Actuator was used to expose health and metrics endpoints, while Zipkin was deployed to track distributed requests across microservices. Kubernetes logs and kubectl commands were extensively used to debug and manage the services.
Database logs were checked by directly connecting to the PostgreSQL instance running inside the Kubernetes cluster, verifying that all job postings, company details, and reviews were being stored correctly.
Final Thoughts
The transition from a monolithic architecture to microservices running in Kubernetes completely transformed Jobify. It became more scalable, resilient, and easier to maintain. Each microservice could be updated independently, ensuring continuous development and deployment without downtime. Docker simplified packaging, while Kubernetes provided robust orchestration and scaling capabilities.
This journey showcased the real-world challenges and benefits of microservices, making Jobify a cloud-native, production-ready platform.
